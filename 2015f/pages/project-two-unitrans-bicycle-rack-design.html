    <div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Your team will be tasked with developing a design to meet a hypothetical need
for <a class="reference external" href="http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu">Unitrans</a>, the public transportation system
in Davis. Davis is known as the &quot;Bicycle Capital of the United States&quot; and
Unitrans finally wants to figure out how to carry bicycles on their buses like
many other transit authorities in the country <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. Your team's job will be to
develop a detailed mechanical design for a dual bicycle rack that is mounted to
the front of a typical Unitrans bus. The design will have to meet a number of
constraints and have a variety of features, all while being safe, easy to
operate, easy to maintain, and be cost effective.</p>

<div class="section" id="educational-objectives">
<h2>Educational Objectives</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To learn to effectively use engineering analyses to guide design decisions in
an open ended problem.</li>
<li>To develop team work and collaboration skills around a technical mission.</li>
<li>To be able to describe your design using verbal, written, and graphical
communication means.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-goals">
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To collectively develop an open ended mechanical design that meets
static/dynamic failure criteria while meeting the stakeholder's needs.</li>
<li>To perform detailed static and dynamic failure analyses for your design to
prove that your design meets all requirements and is safe for consumer use.
You will need to report an overall factor of safety that should be
appropriate for this type of product.</li>
<li>You will need to estimate the cost of manufacture and report an estimated
&quot;Manufacturers Suggest Retail Price (MSRP)&quot; price for the design.</li>
<li>Log your design activities in your design notebook or in electronic documents
and keep you materials well organized.</li>
<li>Include any pertinent information that you find during your research.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-contraints-and-feature-requirements">
<h2>Design Contraints and Feature Requirements</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The bicycle rack must be able to carry at least two normal bicycles (wheel
size 20&quot; to 29&quot;, road and mountain width tire tread). The maximum weight of a
single bike shall be no more than 55 lbs. It will not accommodate
non-standard cycles like unicycles, tandems, recumbents, etc.</li>
<li>The rack should be able to hold a static load of 250 lbs, e.g. a person
should be able to stand on it while washing the window.</li>
<li>The rack must be attached to the front bumper area of the chassis.</li>
<li>The bicycles must be guaranteed not to fall off during transit.</li>
<li>It must be usable by a variety of people and allow for the easiest possible
bicycle attachment to the rack.</li>
<li>The bicycles can not be damaged in any way by the rack.</li>
<li>The footprint of the rack should be as small as possible while meeting other
design needs.</li>
<li>The rack must be manufactured using traditional manufacturing techniques and
made of standard steel or aluminum structural elements.</li>
<li>The rack must be corrosion resistant and designed for an all-weather
environment.</li>
<li>Each bicycle must be able to be loaded independently.</li>
<li>The rack design should never force the user to be on the traffic side of the
bus to load/unload the bicycle.</li>
<li>The operation should be intuitively obvious or clear simple instructions
provided on or near the rack.</li>
<li>The rack itself should weigh no more than 75 lbs and be removable.</li>
<li>The rack should not protrude past the sides of the bus.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="obtaining-information">
<h2>Obtaining Information</h2>
<p>Matt and Jason will act as the project supervisors who are in direct contact
with the stakeholder (Unitrans). To obtain information from the stakeholder or
to find out information that isn't discoverable in your research you will ask
your questions through Piazza. Your questions need to be professional, clearly
communicated, and pointed. They should be written in format, tone, language
that you'd expect to see in professional communication. With good questions we
will provide you with the needed information to clarify the details. But, keep
in mind that there may not always be an answer and it is up to your team to
make the best decisions with the available information. Ask early and often!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="activities">
<h2>Activities</h2>
<div class="section" id="monday-november-2nd">
<h3>Monday, November 2nd</h3>
<p>We will use the class period to introduce the project and begin the ideation
process. After the introduction, you will join your team members to start
developing your design ideas. We will follow this process:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Question Generation (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Individually, on sticky notes, write down as many questions as you can think
of that will need to be answered to complete your design. Stick these notes
onto the wall by your team so every one can see them.</dd>
<dt>Question review (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Read your teammates questions quickly to get an idea of what everyone is
thinking about.</dd>
<dt>Question Grouping (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Pick 3-5 broad topic areas and group the questions into these topics.
Eliminate duplicates by combining them into one question.</dd>
<dt>Design Ideation Sketching (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>At this point you will each go to the sheets of white paper on the walls and
sketch a design independently. Leave room for two sketches per person.</dd>
<dt>Design Sketching Modifications (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Next rotate positions so that you are in front of a teammate's design. Below
the teammate's design, add, subtract, or modify their design to create a new
design.</dd>
<dt>Design Review and Discussion (10 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Now discuss the merits of each design idea. Add new questions and refine
the previous ones that will need to be determined to make decisions about
each design's merits.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tuesday-november-3rd-11-am">
<h3>Tuesday, November 3rd, 11 AM</h3>
<p>At least one team member will visit the Unitrans maintenance facility on campus
to meet with Andrew Wyly, the Maintenance Manager. You will have the
opportunity to ask many of the questions developed during the ideation session
and inspect the bus for technical details. Be sure to bring a camera and a
measuring device. This may be your only chance to inspect the actual bus in
detail.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="friday-november-20">
<h3>Friday, November 20</h3>
<p>If time permits we will have a TBA activity for project 2 during discussion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="friday-december-4th">
<h3>Friday, December 4th</h3>
<p>During the discussion period each team will have a five minute lightning talk
to pitch their design to the rest of the class and judges. Your goal is to show
why your design meets all of the requirements and why it would be the best
choice. You can use any kind of communication media that you want, e.g. the
board, projector, handouts, etc. Your goal is communicate your technical
information as clearly and succinctly as possible. Think carefully about the
mediums you use to do this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reports">
<h2>Reports</h2>
<p>You will create four memos that culminate in a final report. The reports will
all be turned in as PDFs to Smartsite on the respective due date. Each memo
should stand on its own and you will be able to use the content as a base to
develop the final report.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each report or memo must be submitted as a single PDF document.</li>
<li>Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.</li>
<li>The memos and report should be treated as a professional documents and should
be self contained</li>
<li>The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
another engineering colleague or engineering management.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="memos">
<h3>Memos</h3>
<p>The memos are at most one page. The formatting is not strict, but they should
be professional. Use these to report the required progress and to act as drafts
for your final report sections. The more you put into these this less work
you'll need when preparing the final report.</p>
<div class="section" id="plan-and-ideation-friday-november-6">
<h4>Plan and Ideation (Friday, November 6)</h4>
<p>This report should show your team's plan of execution with action items,
milestones with dates, and projected team task assignments. Furthermore, you
should report on the current state of the design, what questions you've found
answers for and the plans for utilizing that information, and the top design
concepts you will pursue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-design-friday-november-13">
<h4>Initial Design (Friday, November 13)</h4>
<p>This report should detail the primary concept that your team has selected to
pursue. You should at least have back-of-the-envelope calculations, drawings,
and other items in place that gives confidence that your design will likely
meet the requirements and hold up to more scrutinous analyses.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ideally pick one main one to start with that you can iterate, but you can
mention multiple design ideas that you haven't chosen yet.</li>
<li>Should have some graphical elements that communicate your design.</li>
<li>Explanation of how your design will meet core requirements and what other
features your are adding.</li>
<li>Thoughts on material choices.</li>
<li>What will be the most likely weak spots for failure and what analysis you
will likely need to use.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="static-failure-friday-november-20">
<h4>Static Failure (Friday, November 20)</h4>
<p>The static failure memo will need to show that your design will have a
sufficient safety factor for static loads.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify the elements with the highest stresses due to static loadings.</li>
<li>Requirement: 250 lb standing on end of rack, but you need to locate other
unique failure points in your design too.</li>
<li>Show individual factor of safety for critical points (hand calcs required,
FEA can be used to support your conclusions)</li>
<li>Report the overall factor of safety for the design.</li>
<li>Justify your material and geometry choices.</li>
<li>Explanations on what you may need to redesign to make it safer: material
choice, geometry changes, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-failure-wednesday-december-2">
<h4>Dynamic Failure (Wednesday December 2)</h4>
<p>The dynamic failure memo will need to show that your your design will have a
sufficient safety factor for dynamic loads.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where are the largest stresses seen from dynamic loads?</li>
<li>How did you estimate the max and min stresses for the critical areas?</li>
<li>What fatigue material properties did you obtain for your material choices?</li>
<li>What magnitude of fatigue stresses are seen?</li>
<li>What factor of safety do you find for fatigue?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-report">
<h3>Final Report</h3>
<p>The final report in PDF format will be due via Smartsite by midnight Sunday,
December 6th.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-format">
<h4>General Format</h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The report should fit on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper[2]_.</li>
<li>All margins should be 1&quot;.</li>
<li>The font of main text should be 11 pt Arial.</li>
<li>Number and caption all figures and tables.</li>
<li>The font size in captions can be 10 pt.</li>
<li>Include page numbers on every sheet.</li>

</table>
</div>
<div class="section" id="title-page">
<h4>Title Page</h4>
<p>The title page should include the title, authors, team name, date, course
number, and an abstract (~150 words).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="table-of-contents">
<h4>Table of Contents</h4>
<p>The second page(s) of your report should include a table of contents, list of
figures, and list of tables showing a title and page number for all items.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-sections">
<h4>Content Sections</h4>
<p>The main content of the report should not exceed 6 pages. The content should
cover, but not be limited to, these topics:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Introduction</dt>
<dd>Provide the reader with the premise and motivation along with describing
what the reader should expect to learn by reading the report.</dd>
<dt>Design Description</dt>
<dd>This should provide a description of the design need, concept, operation,
weaknesses/strengths, etc.</dd>
<dt>Analysis</dt>
<dd>This section should explain the results of the analyses you used to ensure
your design meets the constraints and requirements.</dd>
<dt>Manufacturing</dt>
<dd>This section should provide the estimates and explanations of
manufacturability including costs.</dd>
<dt>Conclusion</dt>
<dd>The conclusion should wrap up your paper and can mention lessons learned and
ideas for the future.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="references">
<h4>References</h4>
<p>All text and materials in the paper that were not created by your team must be
cited here. Be sure to up-hold copyright laws on any included material. Use any
citation style that you prefer that fully communicates the reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h4>Appendices</h4>
<p>The appendices can be any length and contain details that don't belong in the
main text. This should include layout drawings, 3D renderings, detailed
calculations, big tables, etc. Basically, anything that takes attention away
from the main points but provides the details that back them up should go in
the appendices.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lightning-talk">
<h2>Lightning Talk</h2>
<p>Your team will have 5 minutes to pitch your design. The talk will be followed
by 1 minute of questions while the next team sets up. The intended audience for
your pitch will be engineering management and a potential purchaser of the
product, so adjust your content appropriately. You should touch on the design
features, analyses for failure, manufacturing and cost, etc.</p>
<p>Suggestion:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make ten slides that will be shown for 30 seconds each (each team member
makes 2-3 slides).</li>
<li>Each slide has an accompanying script that focuses on the main points.</li>
<li>Pick one person to deliver the talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We will be very strict with time. You will be cut off at 5 minutes!</li>
<li>Can use visuals: doc camera, board, projector</li>
<li>It takes more time than you expect to make it concise!</li>
<li>Your grade will come from the three judges.</li>
<li>The best talk, based on class vote, will get a prize!</li>
