    <div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Your team will be tasked with developing a design to meet a hypothetical need
for <a class="reference external" href="http://unitrans.ucdavis.edu">Unitrans</a>, the public transportation system
in Davis. Davis is known as the &quot;Bicycle Capital of the United States&quot; and
Unitrans finally wants to figure out how to carry bicycles on their buses like
many other transit authorities in the country <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>. Your team's job will be to
develop a detailed mechanical design for a dual bicycle rack that is mounted to
the front of a typical Unitrans bus. The design will have to meet a number of
constraints and have a variety of features, all while being safe, easy to
operate, easy to maintain, and be cost effective.</p>

<div class="section" id="learning-objectives">
<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Students will be able to design a complex mechanical system.</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate the effective use of engineering analyses to guide
design decisions in an open-ended problem.</li>
<li>Students will develop team work and collaboration skills to support a
technical mission.</li>
<li>Students will be able to describe their design using verbal, written, and
graphical communication means.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="project-goals">
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>To collectively develop an open ended mechanical design that meets
static/dynamic failure criteria while meeting the client's needs.</li>
<li>To perform detailed static and dynamic failure analyses for your design to
prove that your design meets all requirements and is safe for consumer use.
You will need to report an overall factor of safety that should be
appropriate for this type of product.</li>
<li>You will need to estimate the cost of manufacture and report an estimated
&quot;Manufacturers Suggest Retail Price (MSRP)&quot; price for the design.</li>
<li>Log your design activities in your design notebook or in electronic documents
and keep you materials well organized.</li>
<li>Include any pertinent information that you find during your research.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-needs">
<h2>Design Needs</h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The bicycle rack must be able to carry at least two normal bicycles (wheel
size 20&quot; to 29&quot;, road and mountain width tire tread). The maximum weight of a
single bike shall be no more than 55 lbs. It will not accommodate
non-standard cycles like unicycles, tandems, recumbents, etc.</li>
<li>The rack should be able to hold a static load of 250 lbs, e.g. a person
should be able to stand on it while washing the window.</li>
<li>The rack must be attached to the front bumper area of the chassis.</li>
<li>The bicycles must be guaranteed not to fall off during transit.</li>
<li>It must be usable by a variety of people and allow for the easiest possible
bicycle attachment to the rack.</li>
<li>The bicycles can not be damaged in any way by the rack.</li>
<li>The footprint of the rack should be as small as possible while meeting other
design needs.</li>
<li>The rack must be manufactured using traditional manufacturing techniques and
made of standard steel or aluminum structural elements.</li>
<li>The rack must be corrosion resistant and designed for an all-weather
environment.</li>
<li>Each bicycle must be able to be loaded independently.</li>
<li>The rack design should never force the user to be on the traffic side of the
bus to load/unload the bicycle.</li>
<li>The operation should be intuitively obvious or clear simple instructions
provided on or near the rack.</li>
<li>The rack itself should weigh no more than 75 lbs and be removable.</li>
<li>The rack should not protrude past the sides of the bus.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="obtaining-information">
<h2>Obtaining Information</h2>
<p>Destiny and Jason will act as the project supervisors who are in direct contact
with the stakeholder (Unitrans). To obtain information from the stakeholder or
to find out information that isn't discoverable in your research you will ask
your questions through Piazza. Your questions need to be professional, clearly
communicated, and pointed. They should be written in format, tone, language
that you'd expect to see in professional communication. With good questions we
will provide you with the needed information to clarify the details. But, keep
in mind that there may not always be an answer and it is up to your team to
make the best decisions with the available information. Ask early and often!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="activities">
<h2>Activities</h2>
<div class="section" id="monday-october-31">
<h3>Monday, October 31</h3>
<p>We will use the class period to introduce the project and begin the ideation
process. After the introduction, you will join your team members to start
developing your design ideas. We will follow this process:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Need Generation (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Individually, on sticky notes, write down as many needs as you can think of
that will need to be answered to complete your design. Stick these notes
onto the wall by your team so every one can see them.</dd>
<dt>Need review (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Read your teammates needs quickly to get an idea of what everyone has come
up with.</dd>
<dt>Need Grouping (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Come up with 3 to 5 broad topic areas and group the needs into these
topics. Eliminate duplicates by combining them into one need.</dd>
<dt>Design Ideation Sketching (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>At this point you will each go to the whiteboards or use butcher paper on
the tables and sketch a design independently. Leave room for two big
sketches per person.</dd>
<dt>Design Sketching Modifications (5 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Next rotate positions so that you are in front of a teammate's design. Below
the teammate's design, add, subtract, or modify their design to create a new
design.</dd>
<dt>Design Review and Discussion (10 minutes)</dt>
<dd>Now discuss the merits of each design idea. Add new needs and refine the
previous ones that will need to be determined to make decisions about each
design's merits.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="thursday-november-3">
<h3>Thursday, November 3</h3>
<p>At least one team member will visit the Unitrans maintenance facility on campus
to meet with Andrew Wyly, the Maintenance Manager. You will have the
opportunity to ask many questions to discover new needs and inspect the bus for
technical details. Be sure to bring a camera and a measuring device. This may
be your only chance to inspect the actual bus in detail.</p>
<p>Location: <a class="reference external" href="http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?b=173">http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?b=173</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="friday-november-4">
<h3>Friday, November 4</h3>
<p>This activity is intended to introduce students to lightweight prototyping.
Prototyping can be a very useful tool for visualizing a design and even testing
it for structural integrity and function. You will be responsible for bringing
to detailed sketches of the top two design ideas you have to class. During
class you will build simply prototypes of the design ideas and then evaluate
them in terms of structural integrity and function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="friday-december-2">
<h3>Friday, December 2</h3>
<p>During the discussion period each team will have a five minute lightning talk
to pitch their design to the rest of the class and judges. Your goal is to show
why your design meets all of the requirements and why it would be the best
choice. You can use any kind of communication media that you want, e.g. the
board, projector, handouts, etc. Your goal is communicate your technical
information as clearly and succinctly as possible. Think carefully about the
mediums you use to do this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="memos-and-reports">
<h2>Memos and Reports</h2>
<p>You will create four memos and a final report. The reports will all be turned
in as PDFs to Canvas on the respective due date by 5pm. Each memo should stand
on its own and you will be able to use the content as a base to develop the
final report.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Each report or memo must be submitted as a single PDF document.</li>
<li>Your group is free to use any software you prefer to prepare the documents.</li>
<li>The memos and report should be treated as professional documents and should
be self contained.</li>
<li>The audience you should write for is a technically competent reader, e.g.
another engineering colleague or engineering management.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="memos">
<h3>Memos</h3>
<p>The memos are at most one page. The formatting is not strict, but they should
be professional. Use these to report the required progress and to act as drafts
for your final report sections. The more you put into these this less work
you'll need when preparing the final report. The primary purpose of these memos
is to communicate your progress and to get feedback from the instructors.</p>
<div class="section" id="plan-and-ideation-friday-november-4">
<h4>Plan and Ideation (Friday, November 4)</h4>
<p>This memo should show your team's plan of execution with action items,
milestones with dates, and projected team task assignments. Furthermore, you
should report on the current state of your design process, what needs you've
come up with and the plans for utilizing that information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-design-thursday-november-10">
<h4>Initial Design (Thursday, November 10)</h4>
<p>This memo should detail the primary concept that your team has selected to
pursue. You should at least have back-of-the-envelope calculations, drawings,
and other items in place that gives confidence that your design will likely
meet the needs and specifications and hold up to more scrutinous analyses.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Ideally pick one main one to start with that you can iterate, but you can
mention multiple design ideas that you haven't chosen yet.</li>
<li>Should have some graphical elements that communicate your design.</li>
<li>Explanation of how your design will meet core requirements and what other
features your are adding.</li>
<li>Thoughts on material choices.</li>
<li>What will be the most likely weak spots for failure and what analysis you
will likely need to use.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="static-failure-friday-november-18">
<h4>Static Failure (Friday, November 18)</h4>
<p>The static failure memo will need to show that your design will have a
sufficient safety factor for static loads.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Identify the elements with the highest stresses due to static loadings.</li>
<li>Requirement: 250 lb person standing on end of rack, but you need to locate
other unique failure points in your design too.</li>
<li>Show individual factor of safety for critical points (hand calcs required,
FEA can be used to support your conclusions)</li>
<li>Report the overall factor of safety for the design.</li>
<li>Justify your material and geometry choices.</li>
<li>Explanations on what you may need to redesign to make it safer: material
choice, geometry changes, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dynamic-failure-monday-november-28">
<h4>Dynamic Failure (Monday November 28)</h4>
<p>The dynamic failure memo will need to show that your your design will have a
sufficient safety factor for dynamic loads.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where are the largest stresses seen from dynamic loads?</li>
<li>How did you estimate the max and min stresses for the critical areas?</li>
<li>What fatigue material properties did you obtain for your material choices?</li>
<li>What magnitude of fatigue stresses are seen?</li>
<li>What factor of safety do you find for fatigue?</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-report">
<h3>Final Report</h3>
<p>The final report in PDF format will be due via Smartsite by midnight Sunday,
December 4th.</p>
<div class="section" id="general-format">
<h4>General Format</h4>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The report should fit on 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheets of paper[2]_.</li>

citation style that you prefer that fully communicates the reference.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendices">
<h4>Appendices</h4>
<p>The appendices can be any length and contain details that don't belong in the
main text. This should include layout drawings, 3D renderings, detailed
calculations, big tables, etc. Basically, anything that takes attention away
from the main points but provides the details that back them up should go in
the appendices.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lightning-talk">
<h2>Lightning Talk</h2>
<p>Your team will have 5 minutes to pitch your design. The talk will be followed
by 1 minute of questions while the next team sets up. The intended audience for
your pitch will be engineering management and a potential purchaser of the
product, so adjust your content appropriately. You should touch on the design
features, analyses for failure, manufacturing and cost, etc.</p>
<p>Suggestion:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Make ten slides that will be shown for 30 seconds each (each team member
makes 2-3 slides).</li>
<li>Each slide has an accompanying script that focuses on the main points.</li>
<li>Pick one person to deliver the talk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notes</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We will be very strict with time. You will be cut off at 5 minutes!</li>
<li>Can use visuals: doc camera, board, projector</li>
<li>It takes more time than you expect to make it concise!</li>
