    <div class="section" id="introduction">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The first project for the course will introduce you to <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering">reverse engineering</a>.
It is important for an engineer to develop the ability to observe existing
products or systems and determine how they function and why they were designed
they way they were. Most, if not all, new ideas are generated after observing
and experiencing existing engineering solutions <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id2" id="id1">[1]</a>.</p>
<p>During this project you will:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>identify engineered products and systems</li>
<li>explain both verbally and written how an existing product or system functions</li>
<li>identify materials and manufacturing processes</li>
<li>identify engineering design reasoning and decisions</li>
<li>peer review presentations and reports</li>
<li>draft written technical documents about existing designs</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a lead up to the <a class="reference external" href="http://moorepants.github.io/eme150a-website/pages/projects.html">second project</a> in the course. The second project is
focused on designing a bicycle rack for a Unitrans bus. In this project you
will reverse engineer various existing bicycle racks.</p>

<div class="section" id="instructions">
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>The primary task is to maintain a notebook with design information about the
designs you research. You should purchase a notebook with blank line-less pages
so that you can take notes and generate sketches of the products and systems
you observe and discover. Carry the notebook with you regularly and using an
engineer's &quot;eye&quot; keep a log in the notebook concerning your observations.
You'll ultimately need to detail the research you collect in a formal written
report. The report draft will be peer reviewed by your teammates and then
graded by the instructors. Your design notebook must be submitted with the
final written report.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-to-research">
<h2>What to Research</h2>
<p>Many transit systems (bus, rail, etc) allow passengers to bring their bicycles
aboard. For example, Yolobus has front mounted bicycle racks, Amtrak's Capitol
Corridor has bike hooks, Sacramento's light rail has bike hooks, etc. In the
second half of the course your team will be designing a front mounted bicycle
rack for a Unitrans bus. Your job for the first half of the course is to learn
as much as you possibly can about existing bicycle rack technology to help
inform your future design. You should investigate all types of bicycle racks:
those for automobiles, buses, trains, and even stationary racks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="timeline">
<h2>Timeline</h2>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Friday September 23</dt>
<dd>The project will be introduced in class during the discussion section with a
kickoff group sketching activity to get everyone started.</dd>
<dt>Friday Septmeber 30</dt>
<dd>Each student will bring their notebook to class with at least 30 different
bicycle rack designs. Keep in mind that each item can be an aspect of a full
bicycle rack design. <strong>Number your designs.</strong> The instructors will take a
grade for your notebook in class.</dd>
<dt>Friday October 7</dt>
<dd>Continue to collect designs, but during the previous week you should choose
5 designs or design aspects that are you favorite and flesh out the details
of the designs in your notebook with more notes, calculations, sketches,
etc. During class you will present your top two designs to your group in a
&quot;lighting explanation&quot;, i.e. 2 minutes per design with 2 minutes group
feedback per design. We will check for the five detailed designs in class.
<strong>Number your designs.</strong></dd>
<dt>Friday October 14</dt>
<dd>During the previous week you should choose your top design to detail in your
report. First drafts will be due at the beginning of class. To &quot;turn in&quot; the
draft you need to share it via Google drive with both instructors and your
group members. The draft must be shared before the beginning of class on
Friday. We will give an introduction to peer review process during class and
do peer review in class.</dd>
<dt>Monday October 17</dt>
<dd>Each team member should peer review each other team member's report before
class. Each team member must provide at least two positive and two negative
comments on each teammates' paper and any additional comments must come in
positive/negative pairs. Make sure to use the insert comment functionality
and/or the &quot;suggestions&quot; editing mode so that the author of the paper can
choose whether to accept your advice or not. See the shared Google Doc for
more tips.</dd>
<dt>Friday October 21</dt>
<dd>After you've turned in your draft you should work to refine your report
based off of you peer's feedback. The final report is due by beginning of
class this day.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="design-notebook">
<h2>Design Notebook</h2>
<p>To execute this project you should purchase and use a design notebook. A
bookstore or an art supply store will have several types of bound books of 8.5
x 11 inch blank white paper. It is best not to have lines or grids because they
constrain your thinking so get blank pages. <a class="footnote-reference" href="#id4" id="id3">[2]</a></p>
<p>In your notebook, you will make notes and sketches that help you document and
design changes for a particular system. Consider the notebook as your own
personal space, in which you work and think. Use any combination of words and
pictures to help you flesh out ideas. Try to use a mix of quantity and quality,
sometimes go for sheer numbers of ideas and other times try to draw a nice
sketch or do a calculation. If you do work on computer or take photographs
paste these into you notebook. Try to carry your notebook with you all the
time, you never know when an idea or thought will reveal itself.</p>
<p>Be sure to use any relevant engineering knowledge you have gained in previous
courses and this course to enhance your design understanding.</p>

<div class="section" id="things-to-address">
<h2>Things to address</h2>
<p>In your notebook and final report you likely want to address questions such as
these. <strong>You are not required to cover all of these questions nor should these
limit you.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What does it look like (use sketches and/or photographs)?</li>
<li>How big is it? (You could use formal dimensioning or scale relative to some
familiar object.)</li>
<li>What is the working principle?</li>
<li>What power sources are used by the device?</li>
<li>Where are the moving parts and how do they operate? Sketches of the device in
multiple configurations can help.</li>
<li>What materials are used for the various parts?</li>
<li>What functions do any notches or changes in cross-section fulfill?</li>
<li>How does the device interface with the user?</li>
<li>What human need does the device fulfill?</li>
<li>What is the expected design lifetime of this product (time or number of
cycles)?</li>
<li>What happens when the item no longer functions? Can the item be recycled,
reused?</li>
<li>How reliable is the product? What are the consequences of failure?</li>
<li>How is the device used?</li>
<li>What is expected of the device by the user?</li>
<li>What sorts of loads are put on the device?</li>
<li>In what ways would you expect the device to fail?</li>
<li>Where are the highest stresses?</li>
<li>What types of analysis might be used to analyze various parts of the device?</li>
<li>Why are different materials used for various parts of the design?</li>
<li>How is the device assembled?</li>
<li>How are the parts manufactured?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="report">
<h2>Report</h2>
<p>The goal of the report is to explain the designs you studied by giving the
reader an idea of how it functions and why it was designed the way it was.</p>
<p>The main content items we are looking for are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>That the explanation should be communicated through written and graphical
means.</li>
<li>You should identify the &quot;need&quot; that the design was meant to address.</li>
<li>You should comment on whether the need is or isn't addressed well, in your
engineering opinion and explain why you think so.</li>
<li>What are the design's weaknesses and strengths, and why?</li>
<li>That you address one or more of the &quot;things to address&quot; above. If you choose
one it should be thoroughly detailed and less so if you choose more.</li>
<li>You can close with suggestions for improvements to the design if you have
any.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be graded on:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Accuracy and correctness of your design explanation</li>
<li>Utilization of engineering principles in the explanation</li>
<li>Clarity of your ideas</li>
<li>Depth of investigation into the design</li>
<li>Use of effective textual and graphical communication</li>
<li>Formatting (minor)</li>
</ul>
<p>The report for this project must be created using Google Docs. It must include
these pages:</p>
<div class="section" id="title-page">
<h3>Title Page</h3>
<p>This page should include title, author, student id, date, and course number and
an abstract. The abstract should be a very short summary of the project. One
paragraph should be plenty.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="content-pages-three-pages">
<h3>Content Pages (three pages)</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Introduction: Introduce the five designs and what you are you want us to
learn about it.</li>
<li>Detailed explanations and descriptions: Text, figures, tables, equations, etc
that explain the design and address some, more or all of the issues listed
above.</li>
<li>Conclusion: Summary of what you learned and maybe things you'd still like to
learn about the designs.</li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to use visual communication liberally in the report.
Reports should contain a significant amount of visual information such as
sketches, drawings, word maps, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reference-page">
<h3>Reference Page</h3>
<p>Cite sources for any information that you didn't generate yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="appendix">
<h3>Appendix</h3>
<p>You may include an optional appendix with extra details, but you will only be
graded on the above pages. The appendix could include more details of a
calculation or a more detailed drawing/sketch.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="formatting">
<h3>Formatting</h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The Google Doc file name should follow this format:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EME150A-PROJ01-LASTNAME-FIRSTNAME</span></tt>, for example:
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">EME150A-PROJ01-MOORE-JASON</span></tt>.</li>
<li>11 pt Arial font (default)</li>
<li>Default margins</li>
<li>Equations and variables must be created with &quot;Insert &gt; Equation&quot; or &quot;Insert &gt;
Special Characters&quot;.</li>
<li>Figures should have captions. See this <a class="reference external" href="https://chromebookandroidnews.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/how-to-caption-and-wrap-text-around-images-or-tables-in-google-docs/">blog post</a>
for a method of adding captions with Google Docs.</li>
<li>Use whatever citation style you prefer.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-review">
<h2>Peer Review</h2>
<p>You will be responsible for peer reviewing you teammates' work. Each team
member will draft their report using Google Docs. Once the draft is complete
you will need to share the document with your teammates and the two
instructors. You are then responsible for reading and critiquing your team
members' reports with the goal of helping them improve the work. You must
provide two positive and two negative pieces of feedback via the &quot;Insert &gt;
Comment&quot; or &quot;Suggesting&quot; feature in Google Docs. This feedback cannot be the
same as other teammates. Do not edit their paper directly! This allows the
author to decided which comments they want to include or dismiss. If you want
to add more feedback it must come in pairs: positive and negative.</p>
<p>Things to think about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Is the writing clear? Do you understand what your teammate is trying to
describe and express?</li>
<li>Are the images/graphics/sketches clear and explanatory?</li>
<li>Is the document succinct and to the point?</li>
<li>Are the sentences coherent, well-constructed, varied?</li>
<li>What could be added (or subtracted) to give you a better picture and
understanding of the design?</li>
</ul>
<p>Tips:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Stay away from overly general comments, be specific. For example, &quot;I just
didn't get it!&quot; is not useful but &quot;This sentence is unclear, if you do X and
Y it may become clearer.&quot; is.</li>
<li>Keep it impersonal and be polite. Statements like &quot;this is a stupid idea&quot;
will not be tolerated and cause your project grade to be lowered.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading">
