<p>This course introduces the student to mechanical design theory and methodology
that build on the fundamentals learned in statics, dynamics, strength of
materials, computer aided drafting, and manufacturing. The course will prepare
the student to both individually and collaboratively design mechanical systems
that will be safe from failure and ensure that other design constraints are
met.</p>

<h3>Objectives<a class="headerlink" href="#objectives" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Students will demonstrate the use of analytical skills and intuitive
judgment for mechanical design and the evaluation of structural integrity.</li>
<li>Students will develop and use simple analytic models to predict static and
dynamic stresses and strains in mechanical structures.</li>
<li>Students will identify and use appropriate resources in engineering design
and failure analysis.</li>
<li>Students will solve open-ended design problems that require conceptual and
analytical problem solving and create documentation of design solutions.</li>
<li>Students will demonstrate effective engineering writing.</li>

<h2>Academic Integrity<a class="headerlink" href="#academic-integrity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>The midterm and final exam will be closed note, closed book and done on an
individual basis.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
<p>The first part of the project will be an mostly individual but have elements of
collaboration built in. The second part of the project will be a group effort
but also include individual evaluation based on peer evaluations.</p>

<h2>Textbook<a class="headerlink" href="#textbook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design</em>, Budynas and Nisbett, 10th Edition,
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN 978-0-07-339820-4 [<a class="reference external" href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073398209/information_center_view0/index.html">Book Information</a>]</p>
<p>Reading will be assigned from the textbook. I will do my best to provide the
homework in a way that doesn't require you to purchase the book to read any
problems but this is not guaranteed. Older editions will be more than
sufficient for reading and studying. Keep in mind that this particular textbook
is one of the better references to have for your career if you work in
mechanical design.</p>

<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments-grades" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://canvas.ucdavis.edu">canvas.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late</strong> on all assignments.</p>

<h3>Piazza<a class="headerlink" href="#piazza" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Piazza should be used for all questions about the class, homework, theory,

instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole classes
benefit. The instructors can also endorse the student answer if it is correct.
The top student askers and answerers, to be judged by the instructors,
will be rewarded with bonus points to their final grade. The link to the Piazza
