<p>This course introduces the student to mechanical design theory and methodology
that build on the fundamentals learned in statics, dynamics, strength of
materials, computer aided drafting, and manufacturing. The course will prepare
the student to both individually and collaboratively design mechanical systems
that will be safe from failure and ensure that other design constraints are
met.</p>
<div class="section" id="objectives">
<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>To develop your analytical skills and intuitive judgment in mechanical
design and the evaluation of structural integrity.</li>
<li>To improve your skills in identifying and using appropriate resources in
engineering design and failure analysis.</li>
<li>To expose you to open-ended design problems that require conceptual and
analytical problem solving and documentation of a design solution.</li>
<li>To enhance your skills in engineering writing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Time and Location</h2>
<p>The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:00-9:50 AM and
Fridays 9:00-10:50 AM in 1132 Bainer.</p>
<p><strong>If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the midterm or
exam, you must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only
exception).</strong></p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>
<p>Jason will hold office hours on Wednesdays and Fridays from 2-3PM in Bainer
2095.</p>
<p>Matthew will hold office hours on Thursdays and Fridays from 11AM-12PM in the
Computer Aided Engineering Lab (2121A) Bainer Hall.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="academic-integrity">
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html">Academic Integrity
web page</a> from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis <a class="reference external" href="http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html">code of academic conduct</a>.</p>
<p>The midterm and final exam will be closed note, closed book and done on an
individual basis.</p>
<p>Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a <em>unique</em> solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.</p>
<p>The first project will be an individual project but have elements of
collaboration built in. The second project will be a group effort but also
include individual evaluation along with peer evaluations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="textbook">
<h2>Textbook</h2>
<p><em>Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design</em>, Budynas and Nisbett, 10th Edition,
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN 978-0-07-339820-4 [<a class="reference external" href="http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073398209/information_center_view0/index.html">Book Information</a>]</p>
<p>Both reading will be assigned from the textbook. A copy of the textbook will be
available on two-hour reserve at the library. I will do my best to provide the
homework in a way that doesn't require you purchase the book to read any
problems but this is not guaranteed. Older editions will be more than
sufficient for reading and studying. Keep in mind that this particular textbook
is one of the better references to have for your career if you work in
mechanical design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments-grades">
<h2>Assignments &amp; Grades</h2>
<p>Grades will be available in the <a class="reference external" href="http://smartsite.ucdavis.edu">smartsite.ucdavis.edu</a> grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that <strong>15% is deducted
per business day late</strong> on all assignments. Take extra caution if you believe
your exams or assignments to be incorrectly graded. If the request for
additional points is found <strong>NOT</strong> to be valid, the points may be
<strong>subtracted</strong> from the total score of the assignment or exam.</p>
